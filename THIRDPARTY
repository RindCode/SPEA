     (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
     license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants

     and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.

     (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
     license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants
     you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed

     otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works
     of the contribution in the software.

3.  Conditions and Limitations
     (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use
     any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

     (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that

     contributor to the software ends automatically.

     (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
     copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in
     the software.

     (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form,
     you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of
     this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the
     software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a
     license that complies with this license.

     (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
     contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You
     may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this
     license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the
     contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
